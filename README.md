# Final Project of Cryptography

# Author: Chau Ta, Cole Koryto

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Download all dependencies

### Frontend: go in client folder and `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Start a new voting

Remember to delete database.db and run the script again


## Running offline basic example
If you go to src in the main branch you can run `main.py` to running a simulation of the voting
system that runs a random election. This code can be used to get a better understanding of the 
underlying cryptographical systems utlized in this voting system without having to digest the 
entire website code base.
